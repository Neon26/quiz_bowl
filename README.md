# Quiz Bowl Project

An attempt at connecting a Quiz with an API

## Description

This poject was a project that help me understand advanced API's. It helped have a better understanding of token authorizations. Also helped me come to terms with the terms: "Get, Post, Put, and Delete". I was able to login a user in with Basic Auth and allow Users to Register an account.

Users are able to take a quiz with 10 random questions from the API from all users questions 
After the question is completed the user is Awarded a score based on there correct or incorrect response

If the User is has admin previalges, they are prompted with extra prompts.
They should also be able to take the quiz like a normal user
